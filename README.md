# Product Landing Page

## Tests for Product Landing Page

### Content

1. My product landing page should have a &lt;header&gt; element with corresponding id="header".
2. I can see an image within the #header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
3. Within the &lt;header&gt; element I can see a &lt;nav&gt; element with corresponding id="nav-bar".'
4. I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class "nav-link".
5. When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.'
6. I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
7. My landing page has a &lt;form&gt; element with a corresponding id="form".'
8. Within the form, there is an &lt;input&gt; field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
9. The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
10. The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
11. Within the form, there is a submit &lt;input&gt; with corresponding id="submit".
12. When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).
